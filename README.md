# Application created for recruitment purposes

Before launching the application locally, you have to:
- create an environment variables file (.env) and place your own api key - VITE_API_KEY=..., which is generated after registering an account on the site -https://newsapi.org/

To create the application, I used:
- typescript,
- react.js,
- redux toolkit, rtk query,
- react router,
- styled components,
- vitest + react-test-library
- i18next (translations),
- custom eslint config
